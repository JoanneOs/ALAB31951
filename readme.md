My MongoDB to Mongoose Adventure

I built this that started with plain MongoDB previous project and upgraded to Mongoose (way cleaner). Hit some bumps:
Fixed install errors with sudo
Solved "Page Not Found" by checking file paths
Made these easy-to-use links:
to see all grades: localhost:5050/grades
find one: localhost:5050/grades/123
and fiilter: localhost:5050/grades?student_id=0
